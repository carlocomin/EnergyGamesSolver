\section{Change Log}

Changes are classified according to their importance. Changes effecting only the performance of
parts of the tool or are less important otherwise are marked with one asterisk ($\ast$). Changes
that are worth noting like the addition of new features etc.\ are marked with two asterisks 
($\ast\ast$). Finally, major changes that would effect usability, for example breaks in backwards
compatibility, changes in the user interface, etc., are marked with three asterisks ($\ast\ast\ast$)

Changes incorporated into version 3:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\ast\ast$] \pgsolver is now linkable as library.
\item[$\ast$] A new local strategy improvement algorithm has been added.
\item[$\ast\ast$] Local Solving of Games has been enabled.
\item[$\ast$] Generators can now be linked directly into \pgsolver.
\item[$\ast$] Two new randomized strategy improvement algorithms have been incorporated.
\item[$\ast$] The lists of solvers and generators are now maintained in \texttt{./Solvers} and \texttt{./Generators} respectively.
\item[$\ast$] Printing and parsing of solution and strategies.
\item[$\ast$] Conversion between min-parity and max-parity games as a new transformer feature.
\item[$\ast$] Two new generators: Towers of Hanoi as a reachability game and a fairness verification of an elevator system.
\end{itemize} 



Changes incorporated into version 2:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\ast$] In order to allow more efficient parsing, the specification format for parity
      games has been extended. It is now possible to include at the beginning of the specification
      the maximal index of a node in the game. If this is done, then parsing will be quicker.
\item[$\ast$] All the random game generators are now based on a more efficient generation
      of sets of random numbers.
\item[$\ast$] The computation of attractor regions has been improved.
\item[$\ast\ast\ast$] Confusing terminology has been clarified: the algorithm due to Stevens and
     Stirling \cite{StevensStirling98} is now referred to as the \emph{model checker} rather than the 
     former \emph{game-based algorithm}. Command line parameters to \texttt{pgsolver} have been 
     changed accordingly.
\item[$\ast\ast$] A useful benchmarking tool has been included in the distribution.
\item[$\ast$] This change log has been included in this documentation -- in case you hadn't noticed.
\end{itemize}
